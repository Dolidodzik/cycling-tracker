# react-native-expo-boilerplate
This is boiler plate i use in my day to day project
It contains SafeArea View for your Screen Component so you do not have to worry for status bar nodges.
It provide architecture where you clearly see where to put your screens, resuable component, fonts, Navigation , Custom Header, Constants etc
This make intial archtecture for your new project easy and you are ready to go.
You do not have to waste hour for setting the basic architecture for any new project you do.
